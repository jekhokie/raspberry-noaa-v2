# Hardware Cheat Sheet

This document details various hardware that has been tested and/or confirmed in use by users of this framework, as well
as known "non-working" models of hardware to help speed adoption of this framework for new users.

## Raspberry Pi

Below are Raspberry Pi models that are in use and confirmed working with this framework:

* Raspberry Pi 4 (2GB)
* Raspberry Pi 3 B+
* Raspberry Pi 3 B
* Raspberry Pi 2

Below are Raspberry Pi models that have been tested but do *not* work with this framework:

* Raspberry Pi Zero WH: Tested, not working. Lacks sufficient power, resulting in audio recording and wxmap issues.

## Notes on Power

SDR dongles are power hungry and it's important to run a sufficient 2+ Amp power supply with your Pi device. Failure
to use a sufficient power source can result in erorr messages like below in your OS logs:

```
kern  :crit  : [ 1701.464833 <    2.116656>] Under-voltage detected! (0x00050005)
kern  :info  : [ 1707.668180 <    6.203347>] Voltage normalised (0x00000000)
```

## SD Card

Any SD card that is functional for a Raspberry Pi should work. Recommendation is to choose a reputable brand (not a knockoff)
and to choose the highest Class/U rating possible to enable faster write and read activity.
