<!--
  ANNOTATION TEMPLATE: Update this to generate an annotation for overlay on your
  captured images - note that you can use ANY of the keys in the file
  config/settings.yml in addition to the following keys, which will be passed when
  the script is called during capture image processing:

    * capture_start - start time of the capture
    * enhancement - name of the enhancement to be used
    * sat_max_elevation - maximum elevation that the satellite reaches
    * sat_name - name of the satellite
    * sun_elevation - elevation of the sun during the capture
    * pass_direction - direction of the satellite pass (relative to ground station)
    * pass_side - whether the pass was east/west of the base station (represented as "E" or "W")
    * pass_side_long - long form of whether the pass was east/west of the base station (represented as "East" or "West")
    * gain - SDR gain used for the capture, or 'Automatic' if gain was set to auto-mode (0 or 0.0)

  To have a variable replaced with the injected variables when this template is called, simply
  wrap the variable in double curly braces like this: {{ my_var }}

  If you want to include any images, place the images in the $NOAA_HOME/config/annotation/
  directory alongside this file.
